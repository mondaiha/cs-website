            <td>Edo-era vocabulary, complicated samurai imagery with episodes that are unusually long for anime. The plot is not exactly episodical but each episode usually focuses on a different sword with a lot of historical and samurai terms. Interesting and witty dialogue that tends to go on and on making it difficult to follow.</td>
            <td>In an Edo-era Japan lush with a variety of sword-fighting styles, Shichika Yasuri practices the most unique one: Kyotouryuu, a technique in which the user's own body is wielded as a blade. The enigmatic seventh head of the Kyotouryuu school, Shichika lives quietly in exile with his sister Nanami until one day—the wildly ambitious strategist Togame barges into their lives.</td>

            <td>Extremely fast-paced dialogues, constant references to literary works, obscure cultural references and philosophical considerations all dumped into one big pot. It's already difficult in English, so good luck in Japanese. Really good though.</td>
            <td>The Tatami Galaxy follows an unnamed third-year student at Kyoto University, using parallel universes as a plot device to explore how his life would have differed had he joined a particular student society (called a "circle" in Japan). The majority of the series' episodes follow the same basic structure: the protagonist joins a circle as a freshman, but is disillusioned when the activity does not lead to the idealized "rose-colored campus life" he dreamed of.</td>
