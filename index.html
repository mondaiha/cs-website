            <h2>All Japanese All The Time</h2>
            <p>"All Japanese All The Time" theory was created by an author named Khatzumoto, who learned Japanese to a respectable level in just under 18 months time. "AJATT" is also used as the name for his language learning method.</p>
            <p>Khatzumoto's theory along with TheMoeWay's community was the main inspiration to the Japanese Media Club.</p>
            <p>If you're interested in learning more Khatzumoto's theory, please refer to this page <a href="html/AJATT.html">"AJATT"</a></p>
